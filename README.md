#### 🔐 **Fine Print** – T&C Summarizer for Humans *(Ideation & Research Phase)*  
> Most people blindly accept Terms & Conditions without reading them — not because they don’t care, but because the language is dense, boring, and full of legal traps.  
>
> **Fine Print** is an AI-powered tool that breaks down T&Cs and privacy policies into plain-English summaries. It tells you:  
> • What data is collected  
> • What you’re agreeing to  
> • 🚨 Any red flags (auto-renewals, arbitration, third-party sharing)  
>
> It’s built for everyday users who want **transparency without the 20-page scroll**.
